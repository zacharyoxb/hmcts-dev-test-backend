# HMCTS Dev Test Backend
CANDIDATE NOTES:
To make this work the correct url with username and password needs to be
placed in application.yaml. Personally I just uncommented the current db config and swapped postgres for mysql in the driver class name and url.
I used a localhost mysql instance with my own details. I am not saving the changes to my yaml file for obvious reasons.
