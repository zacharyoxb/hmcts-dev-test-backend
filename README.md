# HMCTS Dev Test Backend
CANDIDATE NOTES:
This does not work as is - you must insert db details into the yaml file (obviously was not going to put own login details in)
Although the standard backend used postgres, I used mysql therefore the driver has also beem changed to that.
Once the db details have been inserted, it should just run after build.
